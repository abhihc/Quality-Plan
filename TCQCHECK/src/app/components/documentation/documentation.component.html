        <p>The main goal of the Test Case Quality Assessment (TCQA) approach is to assess the quality of test cases in
            the
            migration context. The TCQA approach helps in finding good quality test cases that should be migrated. The
            approach also helps in discovering test cases that should be improved before the actual migration process
            and
            test cases that should be excluded from the migration process. In any typical software migration project, we
            have three phases: pre-migration, migration, and post-migration. The TCQA belongs to the pre-migration
            phase.
            The TCQA approach has three main steps, creation of the quality plan, execution of the quality plan, and
            interpretation of the assessment results. The creation of the quality plan aims to develop a quality plan
            for
            the quality assessment of test cases respective to the migration domain. This migration-specific quality
            plan
            assists the testers and migration experts to systematically assess the quality of test cases. The execution
            of
            the quality plan involves defining the guidelines on how to use existing open-source tools and also to
            develop
            new tools to practically implement the measurements defined in the migration-specific quality plan on
            real-world
            migration projects. The interpretation of quality assessment results will guide the migration experts and
            testers to make the decision regarding which test cases should be migrated such that they are beneficial to
            the
            target environment.</p>

    <p>The systematic approach used for the creation of migration-specific quality plan is <a

    </p>

    <h4>Test Case Quality Plan Approach</h4>
    <p>TCQP is a generic approach that guides the process of quality plan creation based on the specific context. In our
        work the
        context is migration. The TCQP approach considers the context of test cases as the basic entity to precisely
        define the quality plan.
        The approach has four main steps: characterization of context, identification of information needs, definition
        of quality understanding, and
        definition of measurements.

    <h5 id="context">Characterization of Context:</h5>
    <div class="justify">
        <p>
            Quality managers and product managers carefully analyse the project's source code and migration domain to
            derive contextual information
            specific to a test case or a test suite. The contextual information is derived based on the context factors
            defined in the context meta-model.
            This step forms the base for further steps in quality plan creation.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h5 id="informationNeeds">Identification of Information Needs</h5>
    <div class="justify">
        <p>
            In this step, a set of goals supporting the quality aspects of the migration context is defined based on the
            context factors obtained from the previous step. The goals are defined in a specific template. Based on the
            goals, a
            set of questions is framed. This step involves a series of discussions among quality managers, testers, and
            migration experts.

    </div>

    <h5 id="qualityUnderstanding">Definition of Quality Understanding</h5>
    <div class="justify">
        <p>
            The questions framed in the previous step are mapped to their respective quality attributes, quality
            characteristics, and quality
            sub-characteristics. The quality characteristics and quality sub-characteristics are derived from Test Case
            Quality Model as shown below.
            The quality attributes are individual testable properties for which measurements will be defined. The main
            motive behind this step
            is to have a common quality understanding among all the stakeholders.

    <h5 id="measurements">Definition of Measurements</h5>

        <p>
            In the final step of quality plan creation, suitable measurements are defined for each quality attributes
            defined in the previous step.
            The measurements are of two types subjective and objective. The outcome of the quality plan is a set of
            measurements that quantifies each
            quality attributes with specific metrics.

    <h3 id="qualityPlanExecution">2. Quality Plan Execution</h3>

    <p> The measurements defined in the quality plan should be supported by a specific measurement tool. This step
        involves
        selecting a set of <a href="http://localhost:4200/tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing
            measurement tools</a> and configuring the tools in accordance with the measurements defined in the quality
        plan.
        A new measurement tool is developed for the measurement which does not have existing tooling support.

    <h3 id="interpretationOfResults">3. Interpretation of Results</h3>

    <p>The last step involves processing the data obtained from the quality assessment tool and transforming the
        numerical data into the graphical format. The visualization of results showcases all the quality aspects defined
        in the migration-specific quality
        plan.This visualization will facilitate the task of deciding which test cases should be migrated such that they
        are beneficial to the target environment.
