    <h2>The Test Case Quality Asessment Process</h2>

    <img src="assets/images/processOverviewNew.PNG" alt="logo" class="process-overview shadow" />

    <p>The test case quality assessment approach in software migration projects helps in finding good quality test cases that should be migrated. The approach also helps in discovering test cases that should be improved before the actual migration process
        and test cases that should be excluded from the migration process.</p>

    <h3>1. Quality Plan Creation</h3>

    <p>The systematic approach used for the creation of migration-specific quality plan is Test Case Quality Plan (TCQP)</p>

    <h4>Test Case Quality Plan Approach</h4>

    <img src="assets/images/TCQPOverview.PNG" alt="logo" class="tcqp-overview shadow" />

    <p>TCQP is a generic approach that guides the process of quality plan creation based on the specific context. The TCQP approach considers the context of test cases as the basic entity to precisely define the quality plan.</p>

    <h4>Test Case Quality Model</h4>

    <div class="quality-model" shadow>
        <mat-tree [dataSource]="dataSource" [treeControl]="treeControl" class="example-tree">
            <!-- This is the tree node template for leaf nodes -->
            <mat-tree-node *matTreeNodeDef="let node" matTreeNodeToggle>
                <li class="mat-tree-node">
                    <!-- use a disabled button to provide padding for tree leaf -->
                    <button mat-icon-button disabled></button> {{node.name}}
                </li>
            </mat-tree-node>
            <!-- This is the tree node template for expandable nodes -->
            <mat-nested-tree-node *matTreeNodeDef="let node; when: hasChild">
                <li>
                    <div class="mat-tree-node">
                        <button mat-icon-button matTreeNodeToggle [attr.aria-label]="'toggle ' + node.name">
                  <mat-icon class="mat-icon-rtl-mirror">
                    {{treeControl.isExpanded(node) ? 'expand_more' : 'chevron_right'}}
                  </mat-icon>
                </button> {{node.name}}
                    </div>
                    <ul [class.example-tree-invisible]="!treeControl.isExpanded(node)">
                        <ng-container matTreeNodeOutlet></ng-container>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </mat-nested-tree-node>
        </mat-tree>
    </div>


    <h3>2. Quality Plan Execution</h3>

    <p>Once the creation of the quality plan specific to the migration context is completed, the quality plan (measurements) needs to be executed. To automate the process of quality plan execution, a set of existing tools are selected and configured in accordance
        with the measurements defined in the quality plan. Proper guidelines will be defined to assist the development of new tools with respect to the measurements in the quality plan.</p>



    <h3>3. Interpretation of Results</h3>

    <p>The last step involves processing the data obtained from the quality assessment tool and transforming the numerical data into the graphical format. The visualization of results showcases all the quality aspects defined in the migration-specific quality
        plan.This visualization will facilitate the task of deciding which test cases should be migrated such that they are beneficial to the target environment.
